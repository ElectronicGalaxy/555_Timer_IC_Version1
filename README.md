# 555 Timer IC Version1

<h2>555 Timer IC - Introduction</h2>
The 555 timer is an integrated circuit (IC) that has the ability to perform timing operations, create single electrical pulse and can be used in a number of modes. In this case, the 555 timer IC is in astable mode. Which is where the output of the IC alternates between a HIGH voltage (close to the Vcc of the IC) and a LOW voltage (close to zero). The duration of the HIGH voltage depends on the resistor and capacitor values.
